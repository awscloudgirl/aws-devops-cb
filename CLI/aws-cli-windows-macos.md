   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual AWS credentials.

## AWS STS `get-caller-identity` Command

After installing and configuring the AWS CLI, you can use the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command to retrieve information about the IAM identity you're using to run AWS CLI commands.

### What Does `get-caller-identity` Do?

The `get-caller-identity` command returns details about the IAM user or role whose credentials are being used to make the request. This is helpful for verifying which user or role is being used for a particular AWS session.

### Example Command

Run the following command to get information about your current AWS identity:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Example Output:

```json
{
  "UserId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
  "Account": "123456789012",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
}
```

- **UserId**: The unique identifier for the IAM user or role.
- **Account**: The AWS account ID.
- **Arn**: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.

### Use Case

You can use this command to verify which user or role is making the AWS requests. This is useful when working with multiple AWS accounts or roles, or when troubleshooting access issues.
