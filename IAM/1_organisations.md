# AWS Organizations Structure for **CloudBinary.io**

This document outlines how **AWS Organizations** is used to manage multiple AWS accounts for a web application like **CloudBinary.io**. This setup follows best practices for separating environments for **Development (Dev)**, **Quality Assurance (QA)**, **Acceptance (ACC)**, and **Production (Prod)**, providing a secure and scalable structure.

## Overview of AWS Environment Structure

**AWS Organizations** helps in managing multiple AWS accounts in a centralized manner. In this setup, each environment (Dev, QA, ACC, and Prod) operates within its own AWS account. The **Primary AWS Account** is used for administrative tasks, such as managing IAM users, permissions, and policies across all other accounts.

### 1. Primary AWS Account

The **Primary AWS Account** is the root of the organization, where administrative roles and policies are managed. This account controls access to all other accounts through the use of **IAM users** and **roles**.

**IAM Users** in the primary account:
- **Developers**: Jack, Peter – Access to services such as S3, EC2, Lambda, RDS, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for development purposes.
- **QA Engineers**: Sam, Mike – Access to services like CloudWatch, API Gateway, and Lambda for testing purposes.
- **Cloud & Ops Engineers**: Jay, Adam – Full administrative access to manage all resources (IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, CloudWatch, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB).

### 2. Development (Dev) Account

The **Dev Account** is the environment where developers build and test features of the application. This account allows them to spin up resources, test functionalities, and make changes freely without impacting other environments.

- **Purpose**: Development environment for backend and UI development.
- **Services**: S3, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, DynamoDB.
- **IAM Users**: Developers like Jack and Peter have full access to the resources needed for development.

### 3. Quality Assurance (QA) Account

The **QA Account** is used for manual and automated testing, ensuring that the code developed in the Dev environment works as expected before moving to the ACC or Prod environments.

- **Purpose**: QA testing environment for end-to-end testing.
- **Services**: CloudWatch, API Gateway, Lambda.
- **IAM Users**: QA engineers like Sam and Mike are granted permissions to perform testing but have restricted access to sensitive infrastructure.

### 4. Acceptance (ACC) Account

The **ACC Account** is where product owners and business stakeholders validate features and confirm that they meet the acceptance criteria before they are released into production.

- **Purpose**: A staging environment where the product is tested by business stakeholders before production.
- **Services**: API Gateway, frontend testing environments.
- **IAM Users**: Business stakeholders and product owners have read-only access to validate product features.

### 5. Production (Prod) Account

The **Prod Account** hosts the live application, which is accessed by end users. It is the most secure and restricted environment, with only Cloud & Ops engineers having access.

- **Purpose**: Live production environment serving the end customers.
- **Services**: S3, EC2, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudWatch.
- **IAM Users**: Only Cloud & Ops engineers (e.g., Jay, Adam) are permitted to manage the live environment and monitor the application’s performance.

## IAM Role-Based Access and Security

In this setup, IAM roles are designed to enforce the **principle of least privilege**, where users are only granted access to the resources they need. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is enabled for all users, ensuring a higher level of security. Below is an example IAM policy for a QA engineer, giving them access to CloudWatch and API Gateway:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:GetLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "apigateway:GET",
                "apigateway:POST",
                "apigateway:PUT",
                "apigateway:DELETE"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy ensures that QA engineers can access the services they need for testing, such as viewing logs and interacting with the API Gateway, without having the ability to alter the infrastructure.

## Benefits of Using AWS Organizations

### 1. **Security**
With AWS Organizations, **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** can be applied to enforce security policies across all accounts. Each environment is isolated, ensuring that any incidents in one environment don’t impact the others.

### 2. **Cost Management**
Each AWS account is billed separately, which makes tracking and managing costs much easier. This allows the business to understand how much each phase of the application lifecycle costs.

### 3. **Scalability**
As the application grows, more environments or accounts can easily be added to the AWS Organization without disrupting the existing structure.

## Best Practices

- **MFA for All Users**: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure all accounts and user access.
- **Least Privilege**: Apply least-privilege access policies so that users can only access what they need.
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Use **CloudWatch** and centralized logging for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing activities across all environments.

## Conclusion

This AWS Organizations structure provides a secure, scalable, and cost-effective way to manage the different stages of application development and deployment for **CloudBinary.io**. By separating environments into different AWS accounts and enforcing strict access controls through IAM roles, we can ensure that the application is well-governed and protected at all stages of its lifecycle.
